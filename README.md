# Learning Rust

Welcome to my `learning_rust` repository! This repository contains various sub-folders for the tutorials I have worked through while learning Rust.

Each sub-folder will contain a cargo created folder structure, with the source code in "src" and any additional notes or resources related to the tutorial.

Starting of course with the classic "Hello, World!". Then whatever I find interesting or useful to learn. Eventually I hope to use it for the advent of code challenges.
